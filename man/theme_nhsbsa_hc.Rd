\description{
Theme an NHSBSA highcharter plot. We would like to take several steps to
brand a standard highcharter plot to an NHSBSA looking chart. These include:
\itemize{
\item Make the font of any text "TT Arial" or another \code{family} parameter.
\item Colour any text NHS Black
\item Colour background NHS White
\item Make the title and axis titles bold
\item Move the legend to the top and set the hover colour to NHS Mid Grey
\item Colour axis ticks and lines NHS Mid Grey
\item Remove yaxis gridlines (x axis has no gridlines by default)
\item Add credits (Note: Not working at the moment)
}
}
